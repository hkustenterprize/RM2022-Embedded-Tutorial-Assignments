# RM2022 Embedded Tutorial Arrangement
The embedded coaching will be from 9.22 to 10.23, after which everyone will have an intra-team competition. We will use your homework grade and competition results as the assessment criteria for joining the team.   
The tutorial will be a combination of online and offline, please make sure you have understood the knowledge in the online video before taking the offline sessions. The online video mainly teaches the required knowledge, and the offline course will be homework guidance and QA.

## 5. Special Arrangement for online student
1. Online students refer to students who are unable to participate in offline tutorial and internal competition but will return to Hong Kong before/at winter semester
2. If you can not come to HK until spring sem, unfortunately, we are unable to offer you a place in the RoboMaster team this season. We would be happy to see you again in next year's recruitment if you can come back to HK.
3. For online students, please follow all the tutorials and assignments. For assignments that need to demo, if you can’t get the corresponding development kits, please contact us after you have finish coding. We will help to debug and pass the demo.
4. Since you cannot join the internal competition, the winter semester will be your probation period, and your performance during this period will determine whether you can become a full-fledged team member
